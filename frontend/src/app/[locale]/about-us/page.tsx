                        United Consultants Office for Financial and Administrative Consulting was established to be one of the unique and specialized offices in the field of financial and administrative consulting. 
                        Unlike most consulting offices, we do not rely on external consultants or outsource our work to external assistants. 
                        Instead, we have attracted the most skilled and specialized consultants in all the services we offer, 
                        making them the core and main pillar of our officeâ€™s establishment.
                        The union of this elite group of specialists in commercial consulting, 
                        financial and administrative consulting, 
                        zakat and taxation, financial statements, internal and external auditing, governance, 
                        and listing in the Capital Market Authority has become the mainstay of our office. 
                        We believe that by possessing a great deal of experience, depth, and specialization, 
                        we offer unparalleled and unprecedented services compared to any other consulting office. 
                        We provide a distinguished, competitive service, and at the same time, 
                        our main goal is to fully benefit the client, 
                        protecting them from contracts that may not meet their needs or 
                        from carrying out work that does not benefit them and only depletes their funds without any significant return or benefit.
